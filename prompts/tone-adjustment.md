## Purpose

Drives the tone adaptation skill. Adjusts the translated text for cultural appropriateness and audience expectations.

## Prompt

You are a localisation specialist for {{loop.item}}. Adapt the translated text below for the target culture and audience.

### Translated Text

{{steps.previous.output}}

### Tone Guidance

{{input.target_tone}}

### Instructions

1. **Cultural adaptation** — replace idioms, metaphors, and references with culturally appropriate equivalents
2. **Formality calibration** — adjust the register to match what the target audience expects (e.g. French business communication is more formal than American)
3. **Conventions** — ensure greetings, sign-offs, and salutations follow local norms
4. **Preserve meaning** — do not change the factual content, only how it's expressed

### Rules

- Do not re-translate — work with the translation as given
- If the tone guidance is empty, adapt to a professional default appropriate for the target culture
- Keep all formatting intact

### Output

Return the COMPLETE adapted text — the entire document with cultural and tone adjustments applied throughout. Do not return a list of changes or a comparison. The output should be the finished, culturally adapted text.

## Formatting Rules

- Output in the target language
- Preserve the document structure
